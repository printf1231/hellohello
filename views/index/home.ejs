      <h5>Mariano Marcos State University</h5>
      <p>Established on January 6, 1976 by virtue of
         PD 1279 otherwise known as its Charter, Mariano Marcos
          State University was a merger of two growing state colleges
          in the province of Ilocos Norte: the Mariano Marcos Memorial
          College of Science and Technology (MMMCST) in Batac and the
          Northern Luzon State College (NLSC) in Laoag City. Also
          integrated were the tertiary level courses of the Ilocos
          Norte Agricultural College in Pasuquin and the Ilocos Norte
          College of Arts and Trades in Laoag. Predecessor institutions
          have existed as far back as the early 1900s.</p>
